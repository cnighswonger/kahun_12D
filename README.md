Scripting to validate new moon records from the Kahun Papyrus and the date of the Twelfth Dynasty

This was inspired by the excellent work of David Rohl and the New Chronology: [Exodus - Myth or History](https://store.patternsofevidence.com/collections/books-1/products/exodus-myth-or-history-hardcover-book). The intent is to verify again
the data produced during the course of his research and to see if we can get closer to 100% validation.

My own studies indicate there is another roughly 75 years to be squeezed out. I suspect we can get
very close to 100% alignment of the records with the correct year based on what I refer to as
chronological triangulation.

We will see...
